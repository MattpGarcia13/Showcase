## About The "Showcase" Project
This Project was intended to show off what I learned about Reactjs (as well as async js, router and cypress) over the course of 5 weeks. I chose to go with a unique theme I thought would stand out, which is hunting dinosaurs. I also had to create my own API for this project, a link to that can be found below. 

### Wins:

* Learning effective Routing
* Much more experience in Bug Fixing
* Stylizing

### Challenges:

* Learning Cypress
* 2 very persistant bugs (Fixed)
* Navigating through & refactoring a large amount of code

### Built With

* Reactjs
* CSS
* HTML
